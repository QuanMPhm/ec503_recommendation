There are three models, actor, critic and embedding, embedding is used to generate another representation of each item.

Embedding data of IMDB movie dataset is well trained and stored in the 'embeddings.csv' file

Embedding data of MIND dataset is yet to be trained well enough and will be stored in 'embeddings2.csv' file

In 'save' diectory, the actor and critic model session, which is well trained, has been stored here. 

The only differences between 'Data_Generator_news.py' and 'Data_Generator.py' and between 'train_embeddings_news.py' and 'train_embeddings.py' are the ones with '_news'
are based on the MIND, the others are based on the 'IMDB'
